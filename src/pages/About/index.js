    <h1>About us</h1>

    <p>
      We are <a href='https://twitter.com/smartmike' target='_blank'>Mike</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/HugoGiraudel' target='_blank'>Hugo</a>. We met at Edenspiekermann where we worked previously before joining N26 where we try very hard to change the face of mobile banking in Europe.

    <p>
      Speaking of which, we are always hiring JavaScript developers for all types
      of position (junior, senior, intern and also a CTO by the way) so if you fancy a
      career in Berlin, Germany, be sure to keep in touch!
