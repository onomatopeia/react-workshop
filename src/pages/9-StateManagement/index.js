      When building a more complex React app comes the moment to choose a way to
      handle state. For simple scenarios where state is rather scoped, the
      built-in component is usually more than enough.
    </p>

    <p>Below is a simple counter app made with the React state.</p>

    <SectionTitle text="React State" />

    <Code language="jsx">{`/* CounterPlain/index.js */
import React from 'react'

const increment = (state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })
const decrement = (state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })

class CounterPlain extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 }

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>{this.state.count}</div>
        <button type='button' onClick={() => this.setState(increment)}>+</button>
        <button type='button' onClick={() => this.setState(decrement)}>-</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default CounterPlain`}</Code>

    <Example live>
      <CounterPlain />
    </Example>

    <SectionTitle text="Redux" />

    <p>
      However, when things get more complicated and several components need to
      get access to the state of the application, it can be a good time to start
      looking into more advanced solution such as Redux. Side note: this counter
      app is *not* a good example to justify Redux (overkill much).
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Redux
      </a>{' '}
      is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. In other words, it‚Äôs
      a pattern that helps you structure your application in having a single
      source of truth (a store), and a clean way to handle data flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      It all starts with a store. The store is an object on steroids that
      contain the entire state of your app. It is provided to your app through a{' '}
      <code>Provider</code> (wrapping your main component).
    </p>

    <Code language="jsx">{`import React from 'react'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import counterReducer from './reducer'
import Counter from './Counter'

const store = createStore(counterReducer)

const CounterRedux = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Counter />
  </Provider>
)

export default CounterRedux
`}</Code>

    <p>
      The store needs a ‚Äúreducer‚Äù to work. A reducer is a big-ass function that
      takes the existing state of the store as well as an action to perform and
      returns the new state for the store.
    </p>

    <Code language="jsx">{`const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 }
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

export default counterReducer
`}</Code>

    <p>
      An action is a function returning an object with a <code>type</code> key.
      This type tells the reducer what operation to perform. It can be
      ‚Äúdispatched‚Äù, that is, executed in direction of the reducer so it has an
      impact on the store.
    </p>

    <Code language="jsx">{`export const incrementCounter = () => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT'
})

export const decrementCounter = () => ({
  type: 'DECREMENT'
})`}</Code>

    <p>
      Finally our component ‚Äúconnects‚Äù to the store to have access to the
      current state as well as the pre-dispatched actions.
    </p>

    <Code language="jsx">{`import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { incrementCounter, decrementCounter } from './actions'

const Counter = (props) => (
  <div>
    <div>{props.count}</div>
    <button onClick={props.incrementCounter}>+</button>
    <button onClick={props.decrementCounter}>-</button>
  </div>
)

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.count
})

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  incrementCounter: () => dispatch(incrementCounter()),
  decrementCounter: () => dispatch(decrementCounter())
})

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter)
`}</Code>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise A - Increment by 2 with state (very easy)" />

    <p>
      Update the React State example to increment the counter state by 2 instead
      of 1.
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <CounterPlain delta={2} />
    </Example>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise B - Increment by 2 with Redux (easy)" />

    <p>
      Update the Redux example to increment the counter state by 2 instead of 1.
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <CounterRedux delta={2} />
    </Example>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise C - Add by-10 option (medium)" />

    <p>
      Update the Redux example to add two buttons to increment and decrement the
      counter state by 10. The current buttons should still work the same. Hint:
      a Redux action is a function returning the plain JavaScript object of your
      choice.
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <CounterRedux deltas={[1,10]}/>
    </Example>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise D - Cap min and max values (medium)" />

    <p>
      Make it so the counter cannot be incremented higher than 25 and lower than
      -25.
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <CounterRedux />

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise E - Add a reset button (medium)" />

    <p>Add a reset button to restore the counter value to 0.</p>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise F - Dynamic increment / decrement (hard)" />

    <p>
      Add a number input that dictates by how much the two new buttons added in
      exercise C increment and decrement the counter.
