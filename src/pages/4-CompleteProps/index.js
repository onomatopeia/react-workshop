      More often that not, a component will render sub-components which may
      themselves render sub-components, ultimately forming a tree. Think of the
      root node as the trunk, then its components as the branches, which may
      have other branches, and so on.

    <p>
      Here, we render a <code>UserIndex</code> component which renders a title
      and a <code>UserList</code> component, which itself renders some{' '}
      <code>User</code> components.

    <Example live>
      <UserIndex />
    </Example>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise A - Add yourself to the user list" />

    <p>
      Add another entry to the following user list with your name and email (as
      well as your nickname if you use one).
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <UserIndex users={[{ name: 'Agata', email: 'agata@whatever.com' }]}/>
    </Example>

    <SectionTitle text="Exercise B - Add another prop to users" />

    <p>
      Try adding an extra information to users (such as a nationality, or an
      age) and render it the way you want. Pro tip: remember to add some prop
      types validation!
    </p>

    <Example live>
      <UserIndex users={[{ name: 'Agata', email: 'agata@whatever.com', nationality: 'dinosaur' }]}/>
    </Example>
  </div>

export default Page
